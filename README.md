# Autonomous Insect Monitoring System using Deep Learning
### Project by Thy Thy

## 📝 Introduction
Today, I’m excited to present the project I’ve been working on: an **Autonomous Insect Monitoring System using Deep Learning**. Insects such as house flies, mosquitoes, and moths are attracted to food, human presence, and light. Without proper control, they can spread diseases and cause environmental damage. Traditional pest monitoring methods are often inefficient and labor-intensive. To address this, I’ve developed an automated system that monitors and categorizes insects autonomously.

## 🖥️ System Design
The main objective of my system is to **automatically recognize and categorize insects** using the **YOLOv5 deep learning model**. The system captures insect images, processes them, and displays the results on a web platform. This allows users to track insect populations remotely and manage pest control effectively.

## 🎯 Objectives
- **Automate insect recognition** using the YOLO model.
- **Develop a web platform** where users can monitor insect activity in real-time.

## 🚀 Process and Implementation
Here’s how the system works:
1. **Image Collection**: Collected a comprehensive dataset of insect images.
2. **Image Processing with YOLO Models**: The YOLOv5 and YOLOv9 models were employed to identify and categorize insects.
3. **Results Display**: The identified insects and their categories are displayed on a web platform, allowing users to monitor and respond to insect activity effectively.

## 🏆 Conclusion
In conclusion, my **Autonomous Insect Monitoring System** offers a practical solution for tracking and managing insect populations using deep learning. By automating the recognition process and providing real-time data through a web platform, this system can help reduce the spread of diseases and minimize environmental impact. It’s scalable and can be applied in various environments such as **farms, public spaces, and residential areas**.
